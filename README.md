## How to use the report:
The PowerBI document must be downloaded by the user, and when it is opened, it will contain a variety of tables and a report with its pages. The user can filter pages and graphics using the filter page. Other data sources can be linked to and connected by the user, and their tables will appear underneath those of the ones that are currently there.


Due to the abundance of available visuals, the user can utilize the reports to follow the registered devices through time as well as other perspectives of interest.
